## About Me

Hi, I’m Alex, a self-taught and professional full-stack web developer with hands-on experience building and maintaining real-world applications. I focus on writing clean, reliable code and creating solutions that are practical, scalable, and easy to maintain.

I work primarily with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, and I’m comfortable across both frontend and backend development. My background is self-taught, but my experience is grounded in production work and collaborative projects, which has helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and a solid understanding of modern web development workflows.

Currently, I’m working as a Web Developer on Sentry, a Discord bot project, where I contribute to the web side of the platform. My role involves building and improving web features, integrating systems, and ensuring a smooth experience between the application and its users.
